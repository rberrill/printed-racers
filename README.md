# Printed Racers

## Description

Printed Racers is an open-source project aimed at creating a 3D printed, remote control car. Our first design is based on the F1 2023 racing car. This project is a celebration of the maker spirit, combining 3D printing technology with the thrill of racing.

## Goals

- Develop a fully functional 3D printed remote control car.
- Create detailed documentation to allow others to replicate and modify our designs.
- Foster a community of makers interested in 3D printing and RC cars.
- Continually improve and expand our designs based on community feedback.

## Releases

### v1.0
- Initial release of the F1 2023 racing car design.
