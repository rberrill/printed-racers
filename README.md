# Printed Racers

## Description

Printed Racers is an open-source project to create a 3D-printed, remote control car. Our first design is based on the F1 2023 racing car. This project celebrates the maker spirit, combining 3D printing technology with the thrill of racing.

## Goals

- Develop a fully functional 3D printed remote control car.
- Where it makes sense for a part to be 3D printed, it will be, otherwise, use off-the-shelf parts.
- This isn't about compromise. The goal is not a "cheap" car.
- Create detailed documentation to allow others to replicate and modify our designs.
- Foster a community of makers interested in 3D printing and RC cars.
- Continually improve and expand our designs based on community feedback.

## Releases

### Formula RC Car v0.1 - releasing after alpha testing
- Initial beta release of the Formula RC racing car design.
